# We don't currently support resize of EXT4 filesystems mounted
# with sparse_super2 option enabled. Earlier, kernel used to leave the resize
# incomplete and the fs would be left into an incomplete state, however commit
# b1489186cc83[1] fixed this to avoid the fs corruption by clearly returning
# -ENOTSUPP.
#
# This test ensures that kernel handles resizing with sparse_super2 correctly
#
