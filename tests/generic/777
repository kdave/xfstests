# Check open by connectable file handle after cycle mount.
#
# This is a variant of test 477 with connectable file handles.
# This test uses load and store of file handles from a temp file to test
# decoding file handles after cycle mount and after directory renames.
# Decoding connectable file handles after being moved to a new parent
# is expected to fail on some filesystems, but not on filesystems that
# do not really get unmounted in mount cycle like tmpfs, so skip this test.
