# FS QA Test No. 429
#
# Test that no-key dentries are revalidated after adding a key.  Regression test
# for:
#	28b4c263961c ("ext4 crypto: revalidate dentry after adding or removing the key")
#
# Furthermore, test that no-key dentries are *not* revalidated after "revoking"
# a key.  This used to be done, but it was broken and was removed by:
#	1b53cf9815bb ("fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation")
#
# Also test for a race condition bug in 28b4c263961c, fixed by:
#	03a8bb0e53d9 ("ext4/fscrypto: avoid RCU lookup in d_revalidate")
#
# Note: the following fix for another race in 28b4c263961c should be applied as
# well, though we don't test for it because it's very difficult to reproduce:
#	3d43bcfef5f0 ("ext4 crypto: use dget_parent() in ext4_d_revalidate()")
