# FS QA Test No. 386
#
# This test checks the project quota values reported by the quota
# "df" and "report" subcommands to ensure they match what they
# should be.  There was a bug (fixed by xfsprogs commit 7cb2d41b)
# where the values reported were double what they should have been.

# the same value, and as a result the value in the fourth field in
# both the "df" and the "report" output.  For "report", the line we're
# interested in contains our project name in the first field.  For "df"
# it contains our project directory in the last field.
# But if the device name is too long, the "df" output is broke into two
# lines, the fourth field is not correct, so take $(nf-2) of "df"
