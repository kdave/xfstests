#
# Test pagecache invalidation in buffer/direct write/read combination.
#
# Fork N children, each child writes to and reads from its own region of the
# same test file, and check if what it reads is what it writes. The test region
# is determined by N * blksz. Write and read operation can be either direct or
# buffered.
#
# Regression test for commit c771c14baa33 ("iomap: invalidate page caches
# should be after iomap_dio_complete() in direct write")
