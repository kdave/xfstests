# FS QA Test No. 475

# Test log recovery with repeated (simulated) disk failures.  We kick
# off fsstress on the scratch fs, then switch out the underlying device
# with dm-error to see what happens when the disk goes down.  Having
# taken down the fs in this manner, remount it and repeat.  This test
# is a Good Enough (tm) simulation of our internal multipath failure
# testing efforts.
