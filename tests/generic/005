# Note: On Linux, ELOOP limit used to be 32 but changed to 8, and lately
# its become 5.  Who knows what it might be next.
# 
# What we are looking for here is: no panic due to blowing the stack;
# and that the ELOOP error code is returned at some point (the actual
# limit point is unimportant, just checking that we do hit it).
