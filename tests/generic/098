# FSQA Test No. 098
#
# Test that after truncating a file into the middle of a hole causes the new
# size of the file to be persisted after a clean unmount of the filesystem (or
# after the inode is evicted). This is for the case where all the data following
# the hole is not yet durably persisted, that is, that data is only present in
# the page cache.
#
# This test is motivated by an issue found in btrfs.
