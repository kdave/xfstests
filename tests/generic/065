# FS QA Test No. 065
#
# Test fsync on directories that got new hardlinks added to them and that point
# to existing inodes. The goal is to verify that after the fsync log is replayed
# the new hardlinks exist and the inodes have a correct link count.
# Also test that new hardlinks pointing to new inodes are logged and exist as
# well after the fsync log is replayed.
#
# This test is motivated by an issue discovered in btrfs, where the inode link
# counts were incorrect after the fsync log was replayed and the hardlinks for
# new inodes were not logged.
