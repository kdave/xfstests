# FS QA Test No. 240
#
# Test that non-block-aligned aio+dio into holes does not leave
# zero'd out portions of the file
#
# QEMU IO to a file-backed device with misaligned partitions
# can send this sort of IO
#
# This test need only be run in the case where the logical block size
# of the device can be smaller than the file system block size.
