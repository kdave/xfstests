# 36ca7943ac18 ("mm/swap: consider max pages in iomap_swapfile_add_extent")
#
# Xu Yu found that the iomap swapfile activation code failed to constrain
# itself to activating however many swap pages that the mm asked us for.  This
# is an deviation in behavior from the classic swapfile code.  It also leads to
# kernel memory corruption if the swapfile is cleverly constructed.
