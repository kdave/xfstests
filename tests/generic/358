# FS QA Test No. 358
#
# Share an extent amongst a bunch of files such that the refcount
# stays the same while the rate of change of the set of owners is
# steadily increasing.  For example, an extent of 32 blocks is owned
# by 32 files.  At block 1, change one of the owners.  At block 2,
# change 2 of the owners, and so on.
