# FS QA Test No. 435
#
# Test that without the encryption key for a directory, long filenames are
# presented in a way which avoids collisions, even though they are abbreviated
# in order to support names up to NAME_MAX bytes.
#
# Regression test for:
#	6332cd32c829 ("f2fs: check entire encrypted bigname when finding a dentry")
#	6b06cdee81d6 ("fscrypt: avoid collisions when presenting long encrypted filenames")
#
# Even with these two fixes it's still possible to create intentional
# collisions.  For now this test covers "accidental" collisions only.
