# Test that if we fsync a directory A, evict A's inode, move one file from
# directory A to a directory B, fsync some other inode that is not directory A,
# B or any inode inside these two directories, and then power fail, the file
# that was moved is not lost.

# At the moment of this writing, on f2fs file foo exists always at A/foo,
# regardless of the fsync-mode mount option ("-o fsync_mode=posix" or
# "-o fsync_mode=strict"). On ext4 and xfs it exists at B/foo. It is also
# supposed to exist at B/foo on btrfs (at the moment it doesn't exist in
# either directory due to a bug).
