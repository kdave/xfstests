# FS QA Test No. generic/064
#
# Test multiple fallocate insert/collapse range calls on same file.
# Call insert range on alternate blocks multiple times until the file
# is left with 50 extents and as many holes. Then call collapse range
# on the previously inserted ranges to test merge code of collapse
# range. Also check for data integrity and file system consistency.
