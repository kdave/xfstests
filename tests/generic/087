# FSQA Test No. 087
#
# Check if setting the file access and modification times to the current time
# (t) and to a specific timestamp (T) is allowed when expected.
#
# From utime(2): Changing timestamps is permitted when: either the process has
# appropriate privileges, or the effective user ID equals the user ID of the
# file, or [the process is trying to set the timestamps to the current time]
# and the process has write permission for the file.
#
# Note that the last of these tests will always wrongly succeed over NFSv2.
# For NFSv3+, that test will wrongly succeed until kernel commit
# "Disable NFSv2 timestamp workaround for NFSv3+".
