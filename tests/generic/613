# Test that encryption nonces are unique and random, where randomness is
# approximated as "incompressible by the xz program".
#
# An encryption nonce is the 16-byte value that the filesystem generates for
# each encrypted file.  These nonces must be unique in order to cause different
# files to be encrypted differently, which is an important security property.
# In practice, they need to be random to achieve that; and it's easy enough to
# test for both uniqueness and randomness, so we test for both.
