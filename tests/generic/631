# FS QA Test No. 631
#
# Reproducer for a deadlock in xfs_rename reported by Wenli Xie.
#
# When overlayfs is running on top of xfs and the user unlinks a file in the
# overlay, overlayfs will create a whiteout inode and ask us to "rename" the
# whiteout file atop the one being unlinked.  If the file being unlinked loses
# its one nlink, we then have to put the inode on the unlinked list.
#
# This requires us to grab the AGI buffer of the whiteout inode to take it
# off the unlinked list (which is where whiteouts are created) and to grab
# the AGI buffer of the file being deleted.  If the whiteout was created in
# a higher numbered AG than the file being deleted, we'll lock the AGIs in
# the wrong order and deadlock.
#
# Note that this test doesn't do anything xfs-specific so it's a generic test.
# This is a regression test for commit 6da1b4b1ab36 ("xfs: fix an ABBA deadlock
# in xfs_rename").
