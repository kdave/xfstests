# FS QA Test No. 622
#
# Test that when the lazytime mount option is enabled, updates to atime, mtime,
# and ctime are persisted in (at least) the four cases when they should be:
#
# - The inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to file timestamps
# - Userspace calls fsync(), syncfs(), or sync()
# - The inode is evicted from memory
# - More than dirtytime_expire_seconds have elapsed
#
# This is in part a regression test for kernel commit 1e249cb5b7fc
# ("fs: fix lazytime expiration handling in __writeback_single_inode()").
# This test failed on XFS without that commit.
