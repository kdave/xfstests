# FS QA Test generic/397
#
# Test accessing encrypted files and directories, both with and without the
# encryption key.  Access with the encryption key is more of a sanity check and
# is not intended to fully test all the encrypted I/O paths; to do that you'd
# need to run all the xfstests with encryption enabled.  Access without the
# encryption key, on the other hand, should result in some particular behaviors.

# Now try accessing the files without the encryption key.  It should still be
# possible to list the directory and remove files.  But filenames should be
# encrypted, and it should not be possible to read regular files or to create
# new files or subdirectories.
#
# Note that we cannot simply use ls -R to verify the files because the encrypted
# filenames are unpredictable.  By design, the key used to encrypt a directory's
# filenames is derived from the master key (the key in the keyring) and a nonce
# generated by the kernel.  Hence, the encrypted filenames will be different
# every time this test is run, even if we were to put a fixed key into the
# keyring instead of a random one.  The same applies to symlink targets.
#
# TODO: there are some inconsistencies in which error codes are returned on
# different kernel versions and filesystems when trying to create a file or
# subdirectory without access to the parent directory's encryption key.  It's
# planned to consistently use ENOKEY, but for now make this test accept multiple
# error codes...
