# FS QA Test generic/419
#
# Try to rename files in an encrypted directory, without access to the
# encryption key.  This should fail with ENOKEY.  Test both a regular rename and
# a cross rename.  This is a regression test for:
#	173b8439e1ba ("ext4: don't allow encrypted operations without keys")
#	363fa4e078cb ("f2fs: don't allow encrypted operations without keys")
