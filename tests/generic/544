# FS QA Test No. 544

# Ensure that we can reflink from a file with a higher inode number to a lower
# inode number and vice versa.  Mix it up by doing this test with inodes that
# already share blocks and inodes that don't share blocks.  This tests both
# double-inode locking order correctness as well as stressing things like ocfs2
# which have per-inode sharing groups and therefore have to check that we don't
# try to link data between disjoint sharing groups.
