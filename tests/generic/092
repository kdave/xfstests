# FS QA Test No. 092
#
# fallocate/truncate tests with FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE option.
# Verify if the disk space is released after truncating a file to i_size after
# writing to a portion of a preallocated range.
#
# This also verifies that truncat'ing up past i_size doesn't remove the
# preallocated space.
