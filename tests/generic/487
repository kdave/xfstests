# FS QA Test No. 487
#
# Open a file several times, write to it, fsync on all fds and make sure that
# they all return 0. Change the device to start throwing errors. Write again
# on all fds and fsync on all fds. Ensure that we get errors on all of them.
# Then fsync on all one last time and verify that all return 0.
