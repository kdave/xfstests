# FS QA Test No. 073
#
# Test file A fsync after moving one other unrelated file B between directories
# and fsyncing B's old parent directory before fsyncing the file A. Check that
# after a crash all the file A data we fsynced is available.
#
# This test is motivated by an issue discovered in btrfs which caused the file
# data to be lost (despite fsync returning success to user space). That btrfs
# bug was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#   Btrfs: fix data loss in the fast fsync path
