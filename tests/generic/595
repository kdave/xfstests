#
# Regression test for a bug in the FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY ioctl fixed by
# commit 2b4eae95c736 ("fscrypt: don't evict dirty inodes after removing key").
# This bug could cause writes to encrypted files to be lost if they raced with
# the corresponding fscrypt master key being removed.  With f2fs, this bug could
# also crash the kernel.
