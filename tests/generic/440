# FS QA Test No. 440
#
# Test that when the filesystem tries to enforce that all files in a directory
# tree use the same encryption policy, it doesn't get confused and incorrectly
# return EPERM in cases where the parent's key is cached but not the child's, or
# vice versa.  Such situations can arise following removal of the master key
# from the keyring.  Regression test for:
