# FS QA Test No. 325
#
# Make some pages/extents of a file dirty, do a ranged fsync that covers
# only some of the dirty pages/extents, and then do a regular fsync (or
# another ranged fsync that covers the remaining dirty pages/extents).
# Verify after that all extents were persisted.
#
# This test is motivated by a btrfs issue where the first ranged fsync
# would prevent the following fsync from persisting the remaining dirty
# pages/extents. This was fixed by the following btrfs kernel patch:
#
#     Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after a ranged fsync
