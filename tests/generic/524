# FS QA Test No. 524
#
# Test XFS page writeback code for races with the cached file mapping. XFS
# caches the file -> block mapping for a full extent once it is initially looked
# up. The cached mapping is used for all subsequent pages in the same writeback
# cycle that cover the associated extent. Under certain conditions, it is
# possible for concurrent operations on the file to invalidate the cached
# mapping without the knowledge of writeback. Writeback ends up sending I/O to a
# partly stale mapping and potentially leaving delalloc blocks in the current
# mapping unconverted.
