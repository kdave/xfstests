# Test that if we punch a hole adjacent to an existing hole, fsync the file and
# then power fail, the new hole exists after mounting again the filesystem.
#
# This is motivated by a regression on btrfs, fixed by the commit mentioned
# below, when not using the no-holes feature (which is enabled by default since
# btrfs-progs 5.15).
