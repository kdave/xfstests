# FS QA Test No. 042
#
# Test stale data exposure via writeback using various file allocation
# modification commands. The presumption is that such commands result in partial
# writeback and can convert a delayed allocation extent, that might be larger
# than the ranged affected by fallocate, to a normal extent. If the fs happens
# to crash sometime between when the extent modification is logged and writeback
# occurs for dirty pages within the extent but outside of the fallocated range,
# stale data exposure can occur.
