# FS QA Test No. 041
#
# This test is motivated by an fsync issue discovered in btrfs.
# The steps to trigger the issue were:
#
# 1) remove an hard link from an inode with a large number of hard links;
# 2) add a new hard link;
# 3) add another hard link with the same name as the one removed in step 1;
# 4) fsync the inode.
#
# These steps made the btrfs fsync log replay fail (with the -EOVERFLOW error),
# making the filesystem unmountable, requiring the use of btrfs-zero-log (it
# wipes the fsync log) in order to make the filesystem mountable again (but
# losing some data/metadata).
#
# The btrfs issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patches:
#
#  Btrfs: fix fsync when extend references are added to an inode
#  Btrfs: fix fsync log replay for inodes with a mix of regular refs and extrefs
#
# This issue was present in btrfs since the extrefs (extend references)
# feature was added (2012).
