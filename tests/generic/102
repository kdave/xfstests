# FS QA Test No. 102
#
# TEST busy loop of write and delete in a filesystem.
# Sometimes writes will failed on NO_SPACE when disk almost full
# in btrfs. It is long-term problem since very beginning for btrfs
#
# This issue was fixed by the patchset named:
#
# btrfs: Fix no_space on dd and rm loop < from zhaolei@cn.fujitsu.com >
