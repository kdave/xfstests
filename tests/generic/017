# FS QA Test No. generci/017
#
# Test multiple fallocate collapse range calls on same file.
# For different blocksizes, collapse a single alternate block multiple times
# until the file is left with 80 blocks and as much number of extents.
# Also check for file system consistency after completing this operation
# for each blocksize.
