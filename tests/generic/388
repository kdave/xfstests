# FS QA Test No. 388
#
# Test XFS log recovery ordering on v5 superblock filesystems. XFS had a problem
# where it would incorrectly replay older modifications from the log over more
# recent versions of metadata due to failure to update metadata LSNs during log
# recovery. This could result in false positive reports of corruption during log
# recovery and permanent mount failure.
#
# To test this situation, run frequent shutdowns immediately after log recovery.
# Ensure that log recovery does not recover stale modifications and cause
# spurious corruption reports and/or mount failures.
