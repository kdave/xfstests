# Check uid/gid to/from disk with a user namespace. A new file
# will be created from inside a userns. We check that the uid/gid
# is correct from both inside the userns and also from init_user_ns.
# We will then unmount and remount the file system and check the
# uid/gid from both inside the userns and from init_user_ns to show
# that the correct uid was flushed and brought back from disk.
