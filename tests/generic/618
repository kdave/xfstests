# FS QA Test 618

# Verify that forkoff can be returned as 0 properly if it isn't
# able to fit inline for XFS.
# However, this test is fs-neutral and can be done quickly so
# leave it in generic
# This test verifies the problem fixed in kernel with commit
# ada49d64fb35 ("xfs: fix forkoff miscalculation related to XFS_LITINO(mp)")
