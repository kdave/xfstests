# FS QA Test generic/620
#
# Since the test is not specific to ext4, hence adding it to generic.
#
# Add this test to check for regression which was reported when ext4 bmap aops
# was moved to use iomap APIs. jbd2 calls bmap() kernel function from
# fs/inode.c which was failing since iomap_bmap() implementation earlier
# returned 0 for block addr > INT_MAX.
#
# This regression was fixed with following kernel commit commit b75dfde1212
# ("fibmap: Warn and return an error in case of block > INT_MAX")
