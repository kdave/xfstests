# Race test running out of data space with concurrent discard operation on
# dm-thin.
#
# If a user constructs a test that loops repeatedly over below steps on
# dm-thin, block allocation can fail due to discards not having completed
# yet (Fixed by a685557 dm thin: handle running out of data space vs
# concurrent discard):
# 1) fill thin device via filesystem file
# 2) remove file
# 3) fstrim
#
# And this maybe cause a deadlock when racing a fstrim with a filesystem
# (XFS) shutdown. (Fixed by 8c81dd46ef3c Force log to disk before reading
# the AGF during a fstrim)
