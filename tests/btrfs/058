# FS QA Test No. btrfs/058
#
# Regression test for a btrfs issue where we create a RO snapshot to use for
# a send operation which fails with a -ESTALE error, due to the presence of
# orphan inodes accessible through the snapshot's commit root but no longer
# present through the main root.
#
# This issue is fixed by the following linux kernel btrfs patch:
#
#    Btrfs: update commit root on snapshot creation after orphan cleanup
