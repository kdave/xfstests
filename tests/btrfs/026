# prealloc extent and one compressed extent works correctly.

# Write 80K of data to the range [640K, 720K[ using direct IO. This range covers
# both the prealloc extent and the compressed extent. Because there's a
# compressed extent in the range we are writing to, the DIO write code path ends
# up only writing the first 60k of data, which goes to the prealloc extent, and
# then falls back to buffered IO for writing the remaining 20K of data - because
# that remaining data maps to a file range containing a compressed extent.
# When falling back to buffered IO, we used to trigger an assertion when
# releasing reserved space due to bad accounting of the inode's outstanding
# extents counter, which was set to 1 but we ended up decrementing it by 1 twice,
# once through the ordered extent for the 60K of data we wrote using direct IO,
# and once through the main direct IO handler (inode.cbtrfs_direct_IO()) because
# the direct IO write wrote less than 80K of data (60K).
