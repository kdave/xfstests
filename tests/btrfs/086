# Test cloning a file range with a length of zero into a destination offset

# This made btrfs create an extent state record with a start offset greater than
# the end offset, resulting in chaos such as an infinite loop when evicting an
# inode.
#
# This issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#   Btrfs: fix inode eviction infinite loop after cloning into it

# Now attempt to clone foo into bar. Because we pass a length of zero, the

# the source offset which is zero) - because the adjusted length value is
# zero, it made btrfs create an extent state record for file bar with a start
# offset (64k) greater then its end offset (64k - 1), which is something never
# supposed to happen and for example it made inode eviction enter an infinite
# loop that dumped a warning trace on each iteration.
