# FSQA Test No. 095
#
# Regression test for adding and dropping an equal number of references for
# file extents. Verify that if we drop N references for a file extent and we
# add too N new references for that same file extent in the same transaction,
# running the delayed references (always happens at transaction commit time)
# does not fail.
#
# The regression was introduced in the 4.2-rc1 Linux kernel.

# The 25 blocks extent has a single back reference and it relates to file offset
# mapped by 768th block.


# Now clone our 25 block extent into offset mapped by 150th block. That offset

# made the addition fail as it didn't find the key in the extent tree that it
# was looking for. The failure triggered by this test was related to the 10
# block extent, which got 1 reference dropped and 1 reference added during the
# fsync log replay - when running the delayed references at transaction commit
# time, btrfs was applying the deletion before the insertion, resulting in a
# failure of the insertion that ended up turning the fs into read-only mode.
