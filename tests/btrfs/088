# FS QA Test No. btrfs/088
#
# Test that btrfs' transaction abortion does not corrupt a filesystem mounted
# with -o discard nor allows a subsequent fstrim to corrupt the filesystem
# (regardless of being mounted with or without -o discard).
#
# This issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#    Btrfs: fix fs corruption on transaction abort if device supports discard
#    (commit 678886bdc6378c1cbd5072da2c5a3035000214e3)
