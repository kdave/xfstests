# Create a subvol b under a and then snapshot a into c.  This create's a stub
# entry in c for b because c doesn't have a reference for b.
#
# But when we rename b c/foo it creates a ref for b in c.  However if we go to
# remove c/b btrfs used to depend on not finding the root ref to handle the
# unlink properly, but we now have a ref for that root.  We also had a bug that
# would allow us to remove mis-matched refs if the keys matched, so we'd end up
# removing too many entries which would cause a transaction abort.
