# 3) One file extent item of type BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG that covers the file

# Now write to the unwritten range of the second extent we allocated,
# corresponding to the file range [4M, 5M[, and fsync the file, which triggers
# the fast fsync code path.
#
# The fast fsync code path sees that there is a new extent map covering the file
# range [4M, 5M[ and therefore it will log a checksum item covering the range
# [1M, 2M[ of the second extent we allocated.
#
# Also, after the fsync finishes we no longer have the 3 file extent items that
# pointed to 3 sections of the second extent we allocated. Instead we end up
# with a single file extent item pointing to the whole extent, with a type of
# BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG and a generation of 7 (the current transaction ID). This
# is due to the file extent item merging we do when completing ordered extents
# into ranges that point to unwritten (preallocated) extents. This merging is
# done at btrfs_mark_extent_written().

# Now do some write to our file outside the range of the second extent that we
# allocated with fallocate() and truncate the file size from 6M down to 5M.
#
# The truncate operation sets the full sync runtime flag on the inode, forcing
# the next fsync to use the slow code path. It also changes the length of the
# second file extent item so that it represents the file range [3M, 5M[ and not
# the range [3M, 6M[ anymore.
#
# Finally fsync the file. Since this is a fsync that triggers the slow code path,
# it will remove all items associated to the inode from the log tree and then it
# will scan for file extent items in the fs/subvolume tree that have a generation
# matching the current transaction ID, which is 7. This means it will log 2 file
# extent items:
#
# 1) One for the first extent we allocated, covering the file range [0, 1M[
#
# 2) Another for the first 2M of the second extent we allocated, covering the
#    file range [3M, 5M[
#
# When logging the first file extent item we log a single checksum item that has
# all the checksums for the entire extent.
#
# When logging the second file extent item, we also lookup for the checksums that
# are associated with the range [0, 2M[ of the second extent we allocated (file
# range [3M, 5M[), and then we log them with btrfs_csum_file_blocks(). However
# that results in ending up with a log that has two checksum items with ranges
# that overlap:
#
# 1) One for the range [1M, 2M[ of the second extent we allocated, corresponding
#    to the file range [4M, 5M[, which we logged in the previous fsync that used
#    the fast code path;
#
# 2) One for the ranges [0, 1M[ and [0, 2M[ of the first and second extents,
#    respectively, corresponding to the files ranges [0, 1M[ and [3M, 5M[.
#    This one was added during this last fsync that uses the slow code path
#    and overlaps with the previous one logged by the previous fast fsync.
#
# This happens because when logging the checksums for the second extent, we
# notice they start at an offset that matches the end of the checksums item that
# we logged for the first extent, and because both extents are contiguous on
# disk, btrfs_csum_file_blocks() decides to extend that existing checksums item
# and append the checksums for the second extent to this item. The end result is
# we end up with two checksum items in the log tree that have overlapping ranges,
# as listed before, resulting in the fsync to fail with -EIO and aborting the
# transaction, turning the filesystem into RO mode.
