# Create a 320K extent at file offset 512K, with chunks of 64K having different
# content (to check cloning operations from send refer to the correct ranges).
# After that clone a range that includes a hole and a part of the extent created
# before - the clone range starts at an offset (448K) lower then the extent's
# offset (512K). We want to see the existence of the hole doesn't confuse the
# kernel's send code to send an invalid clone operation (with a source range
# going beyond the file's current size). The hole that confused send to issue
# an invalid clone operation spans the file range from offset 384K to 512K.

# Use offsets and ranges that are aligned to 64K, so that the test can run on
# machines with any page size (and therefore block size).
