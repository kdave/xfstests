# FS QA Test No. 252
#
# Test that send and balance can run in parallel, without failures and producing
# correct results.
#
# Before kernel 5.3 it was possible to run both operations in parallel, however
# it was buggy and caused sporadic failures due to races, so it was disabled in
# kernel 5.3 by commit 9e967495e0e0ae ("Btrfs: prevent send failures and crashes
# due to concurrent relocation"). There is a now a patch that enables both
# operations to safely run in parallel, and it has the following subject:
#
#      "btrfs: make send work with concurrent block group relocation"
#
# This also serves the purpose of testing a succession of incremental send
# operations, where we have a bunch of snapshots of the same subvolume and we
# keep doing an incremental send using the previous snapshot as the parent.
