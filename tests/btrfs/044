# FS QA Test No. btrfs/044
#
# Regression test for a btrfs incremental send issue where under certain
# scenarios invalid paths for utimes, chown and chmod operations were sent
# to the send stream, causing btrfs receive to fail.
#
# If a directory had a move/rename operation delayed, and none of its parent
# directories, except for the immediate one, had delayed move/rename operations,
# after processing the directory's references, the incremental send code would
# issue invalid paths for utimes, chown and chmod operations.
#
# This issue is fixed by the following linux kernel btrfs patch:
#
#   Btrfs: fix send issuing outdated paths for utimes, chown and chmod
