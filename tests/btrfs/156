# FS QA Test 156
#
# Check if btrfs can correctly trim free space in block groups
#
# An ancient regression prevent btrfs from trimming free space inside
# existing block groups, if bytenr of block group starts beyond
# btrfs_super_block->total_bytes.
# However all bytenr in btrfs is in btrfs logical address space,
# where any bytenr in range [0, U64_MAX] is valid.
#
# Fixed by patch named "btrfs: Ensure btrfs_trim_fs can trim the whole fs".
