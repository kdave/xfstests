# FS QA Test No. btrfs/056
#
# Regression test for btrfs ioctl clone operation + fsync + log recovery.
# The issue was that doing an fsync after cloning into a file didn't gave any
# persistence guarantees as it should. What happened was that the in memory
# metadata (extent maps) weren't updated, which made the fsync code not able
# to detect that file data has been changed.
#
# This issue is fixed by the following linux kernel btrfs patch:
#
#    Btrfs: make fsync work after cloning into a file
