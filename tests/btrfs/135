# FS QA Test No. btrfs/135
#
# Test that an incremental send operation works when in both snapshots there are
# two directory inodes that have the same number but different generations and
# have an entry with the same name that corresponds to different inodes in each
# snapshot.

# The receive of the incremental send stream used to fail because it contained
# a rmdir operation with an invalid path. The output of the receive command,
# with verbose mode (argument -vv), was the following:
#
# utimes
# unlink f
# mkdir o257-7-0
# mkdir o259-7-0
# rename o257-7-0 -> o259-7-0/d1
# chown o259-7-0/d1 - uid=0, gid=0
# chmod o259-7-0/d1 - mode=0755
# utimes o259-7-0/d1
# rmdir o258-9-0
# ERROR: rmdir o258-9-0 failed: No such file or directory
#
# When the kernel was computing the send stream and processing inode 258, it
# noticed that in both snapshots this inode is a direct child of inode 259, and
# that in both snapshots inode 259 as an entry with the name "d1". Because of
# that it decided (incorrectly) to issue an rmdir operation using the orphanized
# name of the inode 258 from the parent snapshot (which has a generation of 9).
# However that decision to send an rmdir operation due to the dentry collision
# was incorrect because the inodes with number 259 in both snapshots are not the
# same, they have different generations.
