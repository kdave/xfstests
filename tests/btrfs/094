#
# Test that an incremental send issues valid clone operations for compressed
# file extents.
#
# For some compressed extents, namely those referred by a file extent item with
# a non-zero data offset, btrfs could issue a clone operation in the send stream
# with an offset and length pair that were not entirely contained in the source
# file's range, causing the receiving side to get -EINVAL errors from the clone
# ioctl when attempting to perform the clone operations.
#
# This issue was fixed by the following linux kernel btrfs patch:
#
#   Btrfs: incremental send, fix clone operations for compressed extents
