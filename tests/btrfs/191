# Now before creating the incremental send stream:

# 1) Deduplicate into a subrange of file foo in snapshot mysnap1. This will drop
#    several extent items and add a new one, also updating the inode's iversion
#    (sequence field in inode item) by 1, but not any other field of the inode;
#
# 2) Deduplicate into a different subrange of file foo in snapshot mysnap2. This
#    will replace an extent item with a new one, also updating the inode's
#    iversion by 1 but not any other field of the inode.
#
# After these two deduplication operations, the inode items, for file foo, are
# identical in both snapshots, but we have different extent items for this inode
# in both snapshots. We want to check this doesn't cause send to fail with an
# error or produce an incorrect stream.
