# FS QA Test 243
#
# Test that if we explicitly fsync a file that was previously renamed and its
# size was increased through a truncate operation, after a power failure the
# file has the size set by truncate operation. In between the truncation and
# the fsync, there was a rename of another file in the same directory and that
# file was also fsynced before we fsynced the file that was truncated.

# item and the new name). The inode of file bar2 is logged with an i_size of 0
# bytes since it's logged in LOG_INODE_EXISTS mode, meaning we are only logging
# its names (and xattrs if it had any) and the i_size of the inode will not be
# changed when the log is replayed.

# Because the inode did not have the flag BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC set, when
# it was logged through the fsync of file foo2, its last_log_commit field was
# updated, resulting in this explicit of file bar2 not doing anything.
