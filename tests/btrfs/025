# FS QA Test No. btrfs/025
#
# Test for an issue in btrfs send where it sent clone operations to user
# space with a range (offset + length) that was not aligned with the block
# size. This caused the btrfs receive command to send such clone operations
# to the ioctl clone API, which would return -EINVAL errors to btrfs receive,
# causing the receive command to abort immediately.
