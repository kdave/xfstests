# FS QA Test 219
#
# Test a variety of stale device usecases.  We cache the device and generation
# to make sure we do not allow stale devices, which can end up with some wonky
# behavior for loop back devices.  This was changed with
#
#   btrfs: allow single disk devices to mount with older generations
#
# But I've added a few other test cases so it's clear what we expect to happen
# currently.
