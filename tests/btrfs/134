# Test that an incremental send operation works after moving a directory into
# a new parent directory, deleting its previous parent directory and creating
# a new inode that has the same inode number as the old parent.

# Remount the filesystem so that the next created inodes will have the numbers
# 258 and 259. This is because when a filesystem is mounted, btrfs sets the
# subvolume's inode counter to a value corresponding to the highest inode number
# in the subvolume plus 1. This inode counter is used to assign a unique number
# to each new inode and it's incremented by 1 after very inode creation.
# Note: we unmount and then mount instead of doing a mount with "-o remount"
# because otherwise the inode counter remains at value 260.
