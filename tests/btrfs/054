# FS QA Test No. btrfs/054
#
# Regression test for a btrfs incremental send issue where the difference
# between the snapshots used by the incremental send consists of one of
# these cases:
#
# 1) First snapshot has a directory with name X and in the second snapshot
#    that directory doesn't exist anymore but a subvolume/snapshot with
#    the same name (X) exists;
#
# 2) First snapshot has a subvolume/snapshot with name X and in the second
#    snapshot that subvolume/snapshot doesn't exist anymore (might have been
#    replaced by a directory with the same name or not).
#
# This issue is fixed by the following linux kernel btrfs patches:
#
#    Btrfs: send, don't error in the presence of subvols/snapshots
#    Btrfs: set dead flag on the right root when destroying snapshot
