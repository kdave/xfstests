# Test that an incremental send works after a file from the parent snapshot
# gets replaced in the send snapshot by another one at the same exact location,
# with the same name and with the same inode number.

# Remove the file and then create a new one in the same location with the same
# name but with different content. This new file ends up getting the same inode
# number as the previous one, because that inode number was the highest inode
# number used by the snapshot's root and therefore when attempting to find the
# a new inode number for the new file, we end up reusing the same inode number.
# This happens because currently btrfs uses the highest inode number summed by 1
# for the first inode created once a snapshot's root is loaded (done at
# fs/btrfs/inode-map.c:btrfs_find_free_objectid in the linux kernel tree).
# Having these two different files in the snapshots with the same inode number
# (but different generation numbers) caused the btrfs send code to emit an
# incorrect path for the file when issuing an unlink operation because it failed
# to realize they were different files.
