# Now clone parts of the original extent into lower offsets of the file.
#
# The first clone operation adds a file extent item to file offset 0 that points
# to our initial extent with a data offset of 4 blocks. The corresponding data back
# reference in the extent tree has a large value for the 'offset' field, which is
# the result of file_offset - data_offset = 0 - (file offset of 4th block).  For
# example in case of 4k block size, it will be 0 - 16k = 18446744073709535232.

# The second clone operation adds a file extent item to file offset mapped by
# 4th block that points to our initial extent with a data offset of 12
# blocks. The corresponding data back reference in the extent tree has a large
# value for the 'offset' field, which is the result of file_offset - data_offset
# = (file offset of 4th block) - (file offset of 12th block). For example in
# case of 4k block size, it will be 16K - 48K = 18446744073709518848.
#
# Those large back reference offsets (result of unsigned arithmetic underflow)
# confused the back reference walking code (used by an incremental send and
# the multiple inspect-internal ioctls) and made it miss the back references,
# which for the case of an incremental send it made it fail with -EIO and print
# a message like the following to dmesg:
#
# "BTRFS error (device sdc): did not find backref in send_root. inode=257, \
#  offset=0, disk_byte=12845056 found extent=12845056"
