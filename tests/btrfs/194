# The wrong check limit is based on the max item size (BTRFS_MAX_DEVS() macro),

# much shorter runtime. So here we use minimal node size (4K) to reduce runtime.

# For 4k nodesize, the wrong limit is calculated by:
# ((4096 - 101 - 25 - 80) / 32) + 1
#    |      |    |    |     |- sizeof(btrfs_stripe)

#    |      |    |- sizeof(btrfs_item)
#    |      |- sizeof(btrfs_header)
#    |- node size
# Which is 122.
#
# The old limit is wrong because it doesn't take devid holes into consideration.
# We can have large devid, but still have only 1 device.
#
# Add and remove device in a loop, each iteration will increase devid by 2.
# So by 64 iterations, we will definitely hit that 122 limit.
