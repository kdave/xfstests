# FS QA Test No. 250
#
# Test that if we write to a range of a NOCOW file that has allocated extents
# and there is not enough available free space for allocating new data extents,
# the write succeeds. Test for direct IO and buffered IO writes.
# The patch that fixes the direct IO case has the following subject:
#
# "btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure when attempting direct IO write into NOCOW range"
