# case 1
#
# The directory named "d" (inode 257) has in both snapshots an entry with the
# name "p1" but it refers to different inodes in both snapshots (inode 258 in
# the parent snapshot and inode 259 in the send snapshot). When attempting to
# move inode 258, the operation is delayed because its new parent, inode 259,
# was not yet moved/renamed (as the stream is currently processing inode 258).
# Later on when processing inode 259, btrfs' send also ended up delaying the
# move/rename operation for this inode, so that it would happen after inode 258
# was processed, creating a circular dependency that resulted in the send stream
# terminating without issuing a rename operations for the inodes 258 and 259.
#

# case 2
#
# When the inode 265 is processed, the path for inode 267 is computed, which at
# that time corresponds to "case_2/d/ance", and it was stored in the name cache
# (to avoid recomputing it again later when needed).
# Later on when processing inode 266, btrfs' send end up orphanizing (renaming
# to a name matching the pattern o<ino>-<gen>-<seq>) inode 267 because it has
# the same name as inode 266 and at that time it's a child of the new parent
# directory (inode 263) for inode 266. After the orphanization and while still
# processing inode 266, a rename operation for inode 266 was generated. However
# the source path for that rename operation was incorrect because it ended up
# using the old, pre-orphanization, name of inode 267.

#
# When attempting to rename inode 283, the incremental send stream included an
# invalid destination path for the rename command. This was due to a missing
# path loop detection in the send code that made the rename of inode 283 happen
# without waiting for the rename of inode 284 to happen first (since it's an
# ancestor in the send snapshot that is beyond the current progress and it was
# also renamed/moved).
