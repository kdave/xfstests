# FS QA Test 199
#
# Test if btrfs discard mount option is trimming adjacent extents across
# block groups boundary.
# The test case uses loopback device and file used space to detect trimmed
# bytes.
#
# There is a long existing bug that btrfs doesn't discard all space for
# above mentioned case.
#
# The fix is: "btrfs: extent-tree: Ensure we trim ranges across block group
# boundary"
