# FS QA Test 049
#
# Test multiple redirects to the same lower dir.
#
# Multiple redirects to the same lower dir will falsely return the same
# st_ino/st_dev for two different upper dirs and will cause 'diff' to
# falsely report that content of directories is the same when it is not.
#
# This test checks that overlayfs detects and fails lookup of a multiply
# redirected dir.
#
# The check for multiply redirected dir was a by-product of kernel
# commit 31747eda41ef ("ovl: hash directory inodes for fsnotify")
