# Test whiteout inode sharing functionality.
#
# A "whiteout" is an object that has special meaning in overlayfs.
# A whiteout on an upper layer will effectively hide a matching file
# in the lower layer, making it appear as if the file didn't exist.
#
# Whiteout inode sharing means multiple whiteout objects will share
# one inode in upper layer, without this feature every whiteout object
# will consume one inode in upper layer.
