# Test mount error cases with exclusive directories
#
# Overlayfs is often used to mount several mounts that share a single
# lower dir, but every overlayfs mount should have its own private
# upperdir and private workdir.
#
# Overlayfs mount on kernel <= v4.12 does not check if upper/work dirs
# are currently in-use by another overlayfs mount on the system and bad
# things can happen with such configuration.
#
# Commit 2cac0c00a6cd ("ovl: get exclusive ownership on upper/work dirs")
# in kernel v4.13 enforces upper/work dir in-use for any overlayfs mount.
# Later stable fix commit 85fdee1eef1a ("ovl: fix regression caused by
# exclusive upper/work dir protection") relaxes mount failure to a warning
# for index=off mount and fails mount with EBUSY for index=on mount.
#
# This test expects success with index=off and EBUSY with index=on
# when trying to mount overlay with:
# - Upper dir is in-use by another overlay mount
# - Work dir is in-use by another overlay mount
