# FS QA Test 034
#
# Test overlay nlink when adding lower hardlinks.
#
# nlink of overlay inode could be dropped indefinitely by adding
# unaccounted lower hardlinks underneath a mounted overlay and
# trying to remove them.
#
# The simplest way to understand this test is this:
# Imagine that you have a tool (e.g. xfs_db) with which you can add
# hardlinks, without changing the value of nlink stored on-disk for the
# inode. This is exactly what this test does when it adds lower hardlinks
# underneath a mounted overlay.
#
# Commit 5f8415d6b87e ("ovl: persistent overlay inode nlink for indexed
# inodes") fixes this issue, although the issue was never exposed in any
# released kernel.
#
# With overlayfs indexed copy up and without the fix, the test triggers
# WARN_ON(inode->i_nlink == 0) in drop_link().
