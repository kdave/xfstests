# Test encode/decode overlay file handle of dir with non-indexed ancestor
#
# Overlayfs with nfs_export enabled, indexes all directories on copy up.
# Directory index is requires for decoding lower directory file handles
# in case ancestors have been renamed.
#
# When enabling nfs_export on an overlay that already has non-indexed
# merge dirs, the possibility of non-indexed ancestor rename requires
# special handling when encoding lower directory file handles.
#
# - Check encode/decode/read file handles of non-indexed merge dir
# - Check encode/decode/read file handles of dir with non-indexed parent
# - Check encode/decode/read file handles of dir with non-indexed grandparent
# - Check decode/read of file handles after rename of non-indexed merge dir
# - Check decode/read of file handles after rename of non-indexed parent
# - Check decode/read of file handles after rename of non-indexed grandparent
#
# This test requires and enables overlayfs NFS export support and merge
# dir rename support (redirect_dir).
# NFS export support depends on and requires overlayfs index feature.
