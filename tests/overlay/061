# Test memory mapped data inconsistencies

# This is a variant of test overlay/016 with mread instead of pread.
#
# This simple test demonstrates a known issue with overlayfs:
# - process A created shared ro mmap on file F
# - process B created shared rw mmap on file F
# - process B writes new data to shared mmap
# - process A reads old data from shared mmap
