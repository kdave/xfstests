# FS QA Test 032
#
# Test concurrent copy up of lower hardlinks.
#
# Two tasks make a metadata change concurrently on two hardlinks of a large
# lower inode.  The copy up should be triggers by one of the tasks and the
# other should be waiting for copy up to complete.  Both copy up targets
# should end up being upper hardlinks and both metadata changes should be
# applied.
