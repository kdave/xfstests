#
# Test overlay file handle of dir with ancestor under lower redirect
#
# Overlayfs with nfs_export enabled, indexes all directories on copy up.
# Directory index is requires for decoding lower directory file handles
# in case ancestors have been renamed.
#
# When enabling nfs_export on an overlay that has merge dirs with lower
# layer redirects, the possibility of ancestor rename requires special
# handling when encoding lower directory file handles from layer > 1.
#
# - Check decode of lower dir with parent under lower redirect
# - Check decode of lower dir with grandparent under lower redirect
# - Check decode of lower dir after rename of lower redirected parent
# - Check decode of lower dir after rename of lower redirected grandparent
#
# This test requires and enables overlayfs NFS export support and merge
# dir rename support (redirect_dir).
# NFS export support depends on and requires overlayfs index feature.
#
# Regression test for kernel commit 2ca3c148a062 ("ovl: check lower ancestry
# on encode of lower dir file handle")
