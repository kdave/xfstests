# Test decoding overlay file handles with warm/cold dentry cache
#
# When opening a non-dir by file handle and the decoded inode/dentry
# are not in cache, the resulting dentry is "disconnected" (i.e. unknown
# path). This is a common case that is already covered by previous tests.
# This test covers the case of decoding an overlay file handle, while a
# disconnected dentry is still in cache.
#
# This test requires and enables overlayfs NFS export support.
# NFS export support depends on and requires overlayfs index feature.
