# The trick here is to get a transaction which is exactly the size of a
# xfs_inode_log_format_32_t or xfs_inode_log_format_64_t
# Prior to the bugfix, this was parsed like an inode due to the size
# match, not as a continued transaction.  If that happens we'll see:
#	xfs_logprint: unknown log operation type (494e)
