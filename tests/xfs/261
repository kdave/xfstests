# FS QA Test No. 261
#
# This test exercises an issue in libxcmd where a problem with any
# mount point or project quota directory causes the program to exit
# complete.  The effect of this is that one cannot operate on any
# directory, even if the problem directory is completely unrelated
# to the directory one wants to operate on.
