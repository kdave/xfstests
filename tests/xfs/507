# to handle one written block every MAXEXTLEN blocks and to reserve 2^32 blocks
# in the COW fork.  There needs to be sufficient space in the scratch
# filesystem to handle a 256M log, all the per-AG metadata, and all the data
# written to the test file.
#
# Worst case, a 64k-block fs needs to be about 300TB.  Best case, a 1k block
# filesystem needs ~5TB.  For the most common 4k case we only need a ~20TB fs.
#
# In practice, the author observed that the space required on the scratch fs
# never exceeded ~800M even for a 300T 6k-block filesystem, so we'll just ask
# for about 1.2GB.

# fork to reduce the amount of work we have to do.
#
# The maximum cowextsize can only be set to MAXEXTLEN fs blocks on a filesystem
# whose AGs each have more than MAXEXTLEN * 2 blocks.  This we can do easily

# the current fsxattr interface specifies its u32 cowextsize hint in units of
# bytes and therefore can't handle MAXEXTLEN * blksz on most filesystems, so we
# set it via mkfs because mkfs takes units of fs blocks, not bytes.
