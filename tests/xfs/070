# FS QA Test No. 070
#
# As part of superblock verification, xfs_repair checks the primary sb and
# verifies all secondary sb's against the primary. In the event of geometry
# inconsistency, repair uses a heuristic that tracks the most frequently
# occurring settings across the set of N (agcount) superblocks.
#
# xfs_repair was subject to a bug that disregards this heuristic in the event
# that the last secondary superblock in the fs is corrupt. The side effect is an
# unnecessary and potentially time consuming brute force superblock scan.
#
# This is a regression test for the aforementioned xfs_repair bug. We
# intentionally corrupt the last superblock in the fs, run xfs_repair and
# verify it repairs the fs correctly. We explicitly detect a brute force scan
# and abort the repair to save time in the failure case.
