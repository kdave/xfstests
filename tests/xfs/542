# FS QA Test 542
#
# Test that COW writeback that overlaps non-shared delalloc blocks does not
# leave around stale delalloc blocks on I/O failure. This triggers assert
# failures and free space accounting corruption on XFS. Fixed by upstream kernel
# commit 5ca5916b6bc9 ("xfs: punch out data fork delalloc blocks on COW
# writeback failure").
