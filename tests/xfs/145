# Regression test for failing to undo delalloc quota reservations when changing
# project id but we fail some other part of FSSETXATTR validation.  If we fail
# the test, we trip debugging assertions in dmesg.  This is a regression test
# for commit 1aecf3734a95 ("xfs: fix chown leaking delalloc quota blocks when
# fssetxattr fails").

# The regression we're testing for is an accounting bug involving delalloc
# reservations.  FSSETXATTR does not itself cause dirty data writeback, so we
# assume that if the file still has delalloc extents, then it must have had
# them when chprojid_fail was running, and therefore the test was set up
# correctly.  There's a slight chance that background writeback can sneak in
# and flush the file, but this should be a small enough gap.
