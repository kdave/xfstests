# FS QA Test No. 189
#
# Test remount behaviour
# Initial motivation was for pv#985710 and pv#983964
#
# mount(8) adds all options from mtab and fstab to the mount command line.  So
# the filesystem either must not reject any option at all if it can't change it,
# or compare the value on the command line to the existing state and only reject
# it if it would change something that can't be changed.
#
# Test this behaviour by mounting a filesystem read-only with a non- default
# option and then try to remount it rw.
#
# note that mount(8) doesn't add the options when specifying both the device
# node and mount point, so test out the various mounting alternatives
#
# <---- Bbbzzzzzzztttt ---->
#
# Right, but the kernel /proc/mounts output in no way reflects what mount passes
# into the kernel, so the entire assumption of this test that what mount outputs
# is the same as what it inputs is completely wrong.
#
# Hence the test now checks to see if the expected options are in the mount
# options in /etc/mtab rather than looking for an exact match. Hence the tests
# check what we know should change, not what mount thinks has changed. As a
# result, the test now passes regardless of whether mount or the kernel controls
# the contents of /etc/mtab....
#
# <---- Normal programming is resumed ---->
