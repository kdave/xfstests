# Regression test for the XFS rmapbt based extent swap algorithm. The extent
# swap algorithm for rmapbt=1 filesystems unmaps/remaps individual extents to
# rectify the rmapbt for each extent swapped between inodes. If one of the
# inodes happens to straddle the extent <-> btree format boundary (which can
# vary depending on inode size), the unmap/remap sequence can bounce the inodes
# back and forth between formats many times during the swap. Since extent ->
# btree format conversion requires a block allocation, this can consume more
# blocks than expected, lead to block reservation overrun and free space
# accounting inconsistency.
