# drive the src/nametest program for CI mode
# which does a heap of open(create)/unlink/stat
# and checks that error codes make sense with its
# memory of the files created.
#
# All filenames generated map to the same hash
# value in XFS stressing leaf block traversal in
# node form directories as well.
