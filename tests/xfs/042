# Test performs several operations to produce a badly fragmented file, then
# create enough contiguous free space for xfs_fsr to defragment the fragmented
# file:
#
# - create fs with 3 minimum sized (16Mb) allocation groups
# - create 16x1MB contiguous files which will become large free space extents
#   when deleted
# - put a small "space" between each of the 16 contiuguous files to ensure we
#   have separated free space extents
# - fill the remaining free space with a "fill file"
# - mount/unmount/fill remaining free space with a pad file
# - punch alternate single block holes in the the "fill file" to create
#   fragmented free space.
# - use fill2 to generate a very large fragmented file
# - delete the 16 large contiguous files created initially
# - run xfs_fsr on the filesystem
# - check checksums for remaining files
