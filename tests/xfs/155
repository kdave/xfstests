# Populate a filesystem with all types of metadata, then run repair with the
# libxfs write failure trigger set to go after a single write.  Check that the
# injected error trips, causing repair to abort, that needsrepair is set on the
# fs, the kernel won't mount; and that a non-injecting repair run clears
# needsrepair and makes the filesystem mountable again.
#
# Repeat with the trip point set to successively higher numbers of writes until
# we hit ~200 writes or repair manages to run to completion without tripping.
