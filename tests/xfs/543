# Some mkfs options store the user's value string for processing after certain
# geometry parameters (e.g. the fs block size) have been settled.  This is how
# the su= option can accept arguments such as "8b" to mean eight filesystem
# blocks.
#
# Unfortunately, on Ubuntu 20.04, the libini parser uses an onstack char[]
# array to store value that it parse, and it passes the address of this array
# to the parse_cfgopt.  The getstr function returns its argument, which is
# stored in the cli_params structure by the D_SU parsing code.  By the time we
# get around to interpreting this string, of course, the stack array has long
# since lost scope and is now full of garbage.  If we're lucky, the value will
# cause a number interpretation failure.  If not, the fs is configured with
# garbage geometry.
#
# Either way, set up a config file to exploit this vulnerability so that we
# can prove that current mkfs works correctly.
