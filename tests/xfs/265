# FS QA Test No. 265
#
# Ensure that we can create enough distinct reflink entries to force creation
# of a multi-level refcount btree by reflinking a file a number of times and
# truncating the copies at successively lower sizes.  Delete and recreate a few
# times to exercise the refcount btree grow/shrink functions.
