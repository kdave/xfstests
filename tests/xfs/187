# 9d5e8492eee0 ("xfs: adjust rt allocation minlen when extszhint > rtextsize")
# 676a659b60af ("xfs: retry allocations when locality-based search fails")
#
# The first bug occurs when an extent size hint is set on a realtime file.
# xfs_bmapi_rtalloc adjusts the offset and length of the allocation request to
# try to satisfy the hint, but doesn't adjust minlen to match.  If the
# allocator finds free space that isn't large enough to map even a single block
# of the original request, bmapi_write will return ENOSPC and the write fails
# even though there's plenty of space.
#
# The second bug occurs when an extent size hint is set on a file, we ask to
# allocate blocks in an empty region immediately adjacent to a previous
# allocation, and the nearest available free space isn't anywhere near the
# previous allocation, the near allocator will give up and return ENOSPC, even
# if there's sufficient free realtime extents to satisfy the allocation
# request.
#
# Both bugs can be exploited by the same user call sequence, so here's a
# targeted test that runs in less time than the reproducers that are listed in
# the fix patches themselves.

# extent that we allocate to the victim file, and it must not be large enough

# Our free space fragmentation strategy is the usual fallocate-and-punch swiss
# cheese file, which means the free space is split into five sections:
#
# The first will be remapped into the victim file.
#
# The second section exists to prevent the free extents from being adjacent to
# the first section.  It will be very large, since we allocate all the rt
# space.
#
# The last three sections will have every other rt extent punched out to create
# some free space.
