# FS QA Test No. 181
#
# Like 121 only creating large EAs
# As part of the iunlink processing in recovery it will call VN_RELE
# which will inactivate the inodes and if they have EAs (which they
# will here) also call xfs_inactive_attrs.
# We want to test out this xfs_inactive_attrs code being called in recovery.
