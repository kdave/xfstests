# xfsdump writes file data in "extent groups", currently 16 MiB in size. After
# writing an extent group or finishing a file, xfsdump will start a new media
# file if it is over the suggested size. With a single 40 MiB file and using a
# suggested media file size of 12 MiB below, this dump will be contained in 3
# media files.
