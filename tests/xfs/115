# FS QA Test 115
#
# Check if the filesystem will lockup when trying to allocate a new inode in
# an AG with no free inodes but with a corrupted agi->freecount showing free inodes.
#
# At the end of the test, the scratch device will purposely be in a corrupted
# state, so there is no need for checking that.
