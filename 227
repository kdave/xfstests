# xfs_fsr QA tests
# run xfs_fsr over the test filesystem to give it a wide and varied set of
# inodes to try to defragment. This is effectively a crash/assert failure
# test looking for corruption induced by the kernel inadequately checking
# the indoes to be swapped. It also is good for validating fsr's attribute fork
# generation code.

# n = number of target fragments for xfs_fsr
#	- only a guideline, but forces multiple fragments via sync writes
#	- start at 4 as that typically covers all extent format situations
#	- end at 12 as that is beyond the maximum that canbe fit in extent
#	  format
# i = number of 2 byte attributes on the file
#	- it takes 6 attributes to change the fork offset from the start value
#	  of 120 bytes to 112 bytes, so we start at 5.
#	- 15 is enough to push to btree format, so we stop there.
# j = number of data extents on the file
#	- start in extent format, but we also want btree format as well, so
#	  start at 5 so that the number of attributes determines the starting
#	  format.
#	- need enough extents that if they are all 3 blocks in length the final
#	  format will be dependent on the number of attributes on the inode. 20
#	  initial single block extents gives us 6-8 extents after defrag which
#	  puts us right on the threshold of what the extent format can hold.
