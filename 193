# Now test out the clear of suid/sgid for chown
#
# From Posix (www.opengroup.org) for chown:
#	"If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR,
#	S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process
#	does not have appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID (S_ISUID) and
#	set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file mode shall be cleared upon
#	successful return from chown(). If the specified file is a regular
#	file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the
#	file mode are set, and the process has appropriate privileges, it
#	is implementation-defined whether the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
#	bits are altered. If the chown() function is successfully invoked
#	on a file that is not a regular file and one or more of the S_IXUSR,
#	S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, the set-user-ID
#	and set-group-ID bits may be cleared."
# i.e.
# reg file + exec-mode-bits set + no appropriate privileges -> clear suid,sgid
# reg file + exec-mode-bits set + appropriate privileges -> maybe clear suid,sgid
# non reg file + exec-mode-bits set + chown success on file (??) -> maybe clear suid/sgid
