# Wrapper for automating benchmarking runs.
# Usage:   bench passes user group [script]
# 
# ..where passes is the number of times to run each script; uid/gid
# gives credentials to use when running the script; and script is a
# simple wrapper around each actual benchmark tool (eg. see run.*),
# if this is ommited, all run.* scripts are used in turn.
# 
# Each run.foo script should report a comma-separated-value list of
# benchmark results on stdout or fail with a non-zero exit code;
# unless the -i option is supplied in which case it should instead
# report a comma-separated-value list of column headers (for report
# generation purposes).
