# create a new FS, mostly fill the log. Then wrap the log back to the
# start bit by bit to force wiping of stale blocks near the end of the
# log. Check the block after the log ends to check for corruption
#
# assumptions : 
#    - given we're only touching a single inode, the block after the
#      log which is in the middle ag should never be touched.
#      if it changes, we assume the log is writing over it
